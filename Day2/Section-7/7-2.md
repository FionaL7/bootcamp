# Performance and Debugging - Generators and Memory

## Large Data with Generators

Use a generator to read a large file line by line.

```python
def read_large_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line
```

## Generator vs List Memory

Use `sys.getsizeof()` to compare the memory usage between a generator and a list.

```python
import sys

data_list = [x for x in range(1000000)]
data_gen = (x for x in range(1000000))

print(f"List memory usage: {sys.getsizeof(data_list)} bytes")
print(f"Generator memory usage: {sys.getsizeof(data_gen)} bytes")
```

## Lazy CSV Filter

Create a generator that yields only rows meeting a condition from a CSV.

```python
import csv

def filter_csv(filename, condition):
    with open(filename, newline='') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        for row in reader:
            if condition(row):
                yield row

# Example condition: Filter rows where the first column value is "John"
filtered_rows = filter_csv('data.csv', lambda row: row[0] == "John")
```

## Short-Circuiting with any()

Use `any()` to check if a number in a big list is divisible by 99.

```python
numbers = [x for x in range(1000000)]
result = any(x % 99 == 0 for x in numbers)
print(result)
```

## Use itertools.islice

Read the first 10 lines from a generator without loading the rest.

```python
import itertools

def read_large_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line

lines = itertools.islice(read_large_file('largefile.txt'), 10)
for line in lines:
    print(line)
```

## Avoid Temporary Lists

Use `sum(x for x in range(1000000))` instead of `sum([...])`.

```python
total = sum(x for x in range(1000000))
print(total)
```

## Streaming File Copy

Copy a file line by line using `with open(...)` and not reading all at once.

```python
def copy_file_line_by_line(src, dest):
    with open(src, 'r') as infile, open(dest, 'w') as outfile:
        for line in infile:
            outfile.write(line)

copy_file_line_by_line('source.txt', 'destination.txt')
```

## Yield vs Return

Replace a loop appending to a list with a `yield`-based generator.

```python
def get_squared_numbers(limit):
    for i in range(limit):
        yield i ** 2

squares = get_squared_numbers(1000000)
for square in squares:
    print(square)
```
